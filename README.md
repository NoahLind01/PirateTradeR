# PirateTradeR
Pirate Trade Network is an interactive R Shiny dashboard built to simulate a dynamic, living economy for tabletop RPGs and pirate-themed D&amp;D campaigns. It tracks the supply, demand, and fluctuating prices of various maritime commodities across a 3x3 grid of interconnected regions and 36 distinct merchants.
